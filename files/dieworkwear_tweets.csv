4/3/24 10:05,'1775434318585983233',"Lots of misinformation in the replies. First, consider whether you need bespoke or made-to-measure. These are two different things. Bespoke means that the tailor is, at least in theory, drafting your pattern from scratch and then producing the garment through a series of three fittings. Made to measure means the garment is produced by adjusting a block pattern, made straight to finish, and then adjusted through a single fitting.

Some body types will require bespoke; others may be ok with made-to-measure. Many will be OK with ready-to-wear. Determining what you need will help you figure out your options.

There are no bespoke tailors in this area. Everyone who uses a bespoke tailor relies on traveling tailors who visit the Bay Area once every three to four months for trunk shows. Since a bespoke suit requires at least two, if not three, fittings and an initial meeting, this puts production well beyond your timeline.

All the options listed in these replies are made to measure, not bespoke. This can be fine, depending on how well you fit into the block pattern. To determine this, ask if they have a try-on suit. This can function as an ""interim fitting."" The more you have to change to the block pattern, the more risk you take. The less you change, the better. All of these MTM operations rely on other factories, often located in other countries, which means production time may still fall outside of your requirements. 

Much depends on your height, chest size, and waist size. As well as your budget. Given the very tight timeline, I would contact all the MTM programs and ask if they have try-on suits and order some ready-to-wear suits to try out. But which suits to order again depends on your body shape.",en,Reply,142,877,5,13,137125,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

4/2/24 0:12,'1774922865235918942',"IMO, it's misguided to think about colors like this bc fashion is more akin to language than an absolute science. To think about how to combine colors, you should first think about the cultural language you want to express and how colors are used in that language. Examples:

I've mentioned many times that our rules around classic men's tailoring largely derive from the cultural practices of British elites during the late 19th century and all of the 20th century. During that period, London business dress consisted of a dark suit worn with a white shirt, dark tie, and black oxfords. Brown shoes were reserved for country sport. Hence the phrase, ""no brown in town."" In this sense, a navy suit worn with black oxfords is always classic. 

Similar combinations and traditions can be found elsewhere. A classic Italian look is a navy suit with black Gucci horsebit loafers; a classic American look is a navy suit with black tassel loafers. Both of these remain classic because their cultural touchpoints continue to hold cultural capital. 

Similarly, a black knit tie is one of the most classic ties you can wear. It goes with suits and sport coat of any color (including navy suits, brass button blazers, and plain navy sport coats). The black silk knit was perhaps most famously worn by the literary version of James Bond, who Iam Flemming described as wearing a dark suit, a clean white shirt, and a “thin, black silk knitted tie.” It’s also heavily associated with other mid-century icons, such as Black jazz musicians and members of the Rat Pack. Again, the combination continues to be good because these cultural reference points continue to hold cultural capital. 

A black leather double rider (a type of motorcycle jacket with an asymmetric closure) looks great with blue jeans because it was the standard rebel-rocker look for much of the post-war period. Think of Marlon Brando striking a rebel pose in The Wild One or the enduring image of The Ramones. This will never not look good because of what such a uniform conveys. 

Any kind of rugged black boot—combat boots, work boots, Doc Martens, etc.—will look great with blue jeans because of the history of punk, workwear, and militaria. If you're wearing an olive field jacket with blue jeans, you'll always look good with black boots because it evokes stories about rugged men that many people find appealing. 

By contrast, you shouldn't wear a black suit jacket with blue jeans because that will make you look like you spilled something on your black suit pants and had to change out of them. Or black leather pants with a blue sport coat because that makes no cultural sense. Understanding how to combine colors relies more on understanding cultural language than it is about memorizing these pithy rules, such as ""blue and green should never be seen without another color in between.""",en,Tweet,900,3436,150,58,630463,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKHG7bNa0AAFqdE.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKHHg73a0AAGRFw.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKHIhaZaMAAohf_.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKHJR17aAAAWUOY.jpg"

A jacket will look more ""suit-y"" depending on a few variables, principally the fabric. A smooth, silky worsted wool with a slight sheen will be very a suit. By contrast, a textured, matte fabric will be more obviously a sport coat. 

There are some other things, such as whether a jacket has a swelled edge, brass buttons, or patch pockets. All these elements can help make a navy jacket look more obviously like a sport coat. Below are some examples of navy jackets that look at home with denim.
